## 👋 Hi there, I'm Minh (aminhp93)

I'm a frontend developer passionate about clean code, strong architecture, and building tools that make life easier for other developers.

🚀 Currently building [**github-coffee**](https://github-coffee.vercel.app) —  
a space for developers who want to grow from _junior to senior_, not just in **tech**, but in **mindset**.

> If you're tired of noisy tutorials and want clarity on the concepts that actually matter — you're in the right place.
