        At Piscada, I start working as front-end developer with 5-7 years old
        codebase. We have fixed lots of painful issues related to current
        structure and old business. Since late 2023, we have started our new
        journey with Nextjs and Microfrontend. We are also working on the new
        features and improvements for the current product.
